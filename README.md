#XMPP to popup

This simple script logs into a specified Jabber account, approves all incoming
subscription requests, and shows every incoming message in a popup window on
the bottom right of your desktop. My intended use case of this is for
interactive comments during my lectures. Not sure if this will work, worth a
shot. :)
