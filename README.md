#XMPP to popup

This simple script logs into a specified Jabber account, approves all incoming
subscription requests, and shows every incoming message in a popup window on
the bottom right of your desktop. My intended use case of this is for
interactive comments during my lectures. The messages can optionally time out
after a set period. Not sure if this will work, but I think it's worth a shot.
